# Graphic Engine
Here's a C++ program using OpenGL that displays models with lighting, shadows, and other little things, but I'll let you discover them for yourself by testing them.

For your information, the software is designed for use, and you can't modify the models. However, perhaps in the future, I'll try to modify it so that you can add models, but with certain conditions for my project to read them.
